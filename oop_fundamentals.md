In this article, you'll be introduced to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a method of programming that focuses on building organized and easily scalable software. OOP is a relatively advanced topic, and it's natural if its purpose and benefits aren't immediately clear. OOP is particularly useful in larger programs that need to scale easily, as it helps with the structure and organization of the code. This guide will cover the fundamentals of OOP, providing you with the knowledge and tools to understand and work with VEX V5 code.

## Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

### What is OOP?

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) represents a significant shift in how we think about and write code. Instead of focusing solely on functions and logic, OOP emphasizes the importance of data structures that model real-world entities and their interactions.

*OOP models real-world entities and interactions between them.*

Previously, we have learned about procedural programming. In procedural programming, the program is organized around functions that process data in a sequence. This means the whole program is focused on how data flows and what operations are performed on it step by step. Itâ€™s a function-focused approach.

OOP, however, is a different paradigm. It focuses on structuring the information and modeling either the real world or a world we want to create through software, such as a game world. This shift in focus allows for a more organized and natural way of thinking about and interacting with data.

For instance, let's say we want to write some code to extract and analyze data from a Stack Overflow survey. The survey data includes information on how many users use certain programming languages, how many years they've been programming, and their working preferences (remote, hybrid, or in-person). In a procedural approach, we would write a series of functions to handle each part of the process: one function to scrape the data from the website, another to store this data into a CSV file, and additional functions to analyze the data. We might count the number of times each programming language is mentioned, determine how many people work in different settings, and perform analysis to identify trends, such as which languages are most popular among remote workers. The program runs these functions in sequence: first loading data, then analyzing it, and then performing further analysis.

Now, consider getting hired at a bank to work on their software backend. In this context, we have users who may or may not have bank accounts. Bank accounts have balances, can receive deposits, and have a deposit history. We can withdraw from an account, make deposits, or transfer money from one account to another through transactions. A transaction includes details such as the amount, the 'from' bank account, the 'to' bank account, and the date and time it was completed. This approach helps in modeling the banking system, capturing the relationships and interactions between users, accounts, and transactions in a structured and organized manner.

By focusing on entities and their interactions, OOP allows us to create software that more closely mirrors real-world systems. This approach can make your programs more intuitive, scalable, and easier to maintain.

### Brief History and Evolution of OOP

Programming became essential as computers were developed to perform calculations and automate tasks. Initially, programming was procedural, involving writing commands that the computer processed in sequential order. Early languages like Fortran and COBOL (1950s-1960s) focused on solving mathematical problems and handling business-related tasks such as payroll processing and inventory management. The C language (1970s) advanced procedural programming for operating systems and complex applications.

The concept of Object-Oriented Programming emerged in the 1960s with Simula, introducing the idea of simulating real-world entities and processes. This marked a shift from procedural programming by allowing more natural and flexible modeling of complex systems.

In the 1980s, C++ built upon C by adding OOP features, addressing the need for better code management as software systems grew. The 1990s saw the rise of Java and Python, both of which are OOP languages. Java's ability to run on any computer system and Python's simplicity and readability brought OOP to a wider audience, making both languages popular for their versatility and built-in tools.

Today, OOP is fundamental in computer science education and a standard practice in software development, helping developers manage complexity, improve code reusability, and create scalable solutions.

## Building Blocks of OOP

### Classes and Objects

In Object-Oriented Programming, classes and objects are fundamental concepts. A class is a blueprint for creating objects, defining their structure and behavior. An object is created from a class, representing a concrete entity based on the class blueprint.

#### Example: Designing a RoboticArm class

Imagine you're designing a fleet of robots for a competition. Instead of writing separate pieces of code for each robot's functionality, OOP lets you create a blueprint for a robot. You can then create as many robots as you need from this blueprint, each with its own unique features but all sharing the same core design.

![Blueprint and designs](./figures/robot-blueprint.jpg)
*A blueprint on the left with three robots modeled from it on the right.*

The blueprint you see on the left is the class, and the specific robots you see on the right, based on the blueprint, are known as objects. All classes have names; let's say the name of this class is `RoboticArm`. This class serves as a template for creating various robotic arms. When you create a robot from this class, you are instantiating the class, and each instantiated robot is called an instance of the class. Each robot shares the same foundational structure but can have unique characteristics.

By creating different robots from the `RoboticArm` class, you can manage their interactions and behaviors in an organized way. This approach allows you to efficiently handle complex systems and ensures that all robots adhere to a consistent design and functionality.

#### Example: Designing a school management system

Consider a school management system with separate classes for `Student` and `Teacher`.

- `Student` class:

  - The `Student` class serves as a blueprint for creating student objects.
  - Each student object, also known as an instance of the `Student` class, represents an individual student.
  - These student instances can then be part of the school system.

- `Teacher` Class:

  - The `Teacher` class serves as a blueprint for creating teacher objects.
  - Each teacher object, also known as an instance of the `Teacher` class, represents an individual teacher.
  - These teacher instances can then be part of the school system.

By defining these classes, you can create student and teacher objects, each of which is an instance of their respective class. However, this is not the complete picture, as we also need to define attributes and methods to fully describe these entities and their behaviors.

### Attributes and Methods

In OOP, the key components of a class are its attributes and methods. Attributes, which are the properties of an object, describe its characteristics. Methods define the actions an object can perform. Attributes are like variables that store data specific to an object. Methods, on the other hand, are functions that belong to a class and define the actions that the object can perform.

#### Example: Robot attributes and behaviors

Imagine designing a class called `Robot`. This class is a placeholder for what a robot is like (its attributes) and what it can do (its methods). For example, a robot might have a name, color, and weight, and it can perform actions like introducing itself.

![Robot objects and their attributes](./figures/robot-class-objects.jpg)
*A class called Robot, and two object instances of this class with their unique attributes.*

One robot can be called "Tom", be blue, and weigh 40 lbs, and another robot can be named "Jerry", be red, and weigh 10 lbs. When you create objects, you can give them custom attributes. However, when it comes to methods, these are less customizable, as we can see that both objects have the same method, which is "Introduce". Nonetheless, each attribute and method is linked to a given object. For example, the `Introduce` method done by the first object and the `Introduce` method done by the second object are not the same method. They always apply to their respective object.

#### Example: Student and Teacher attributes and behaviors

Consider the school management system from before.

- `Student` class:

  - Each student has a name, age, and school ID.
  - Students can perform actions like enrolling in courses and taking exams.

- `Teacher` Class:

  - Each teacher has a name, subject, and employee ID.
  - Teachers can perform actions like teaching classes and grading exams.

By defining these classes, you can create student and teacher objects, each with its own properties and actions. This setup allows for efficient handling of all student and teacher-related operations.

### Objects and Their Relationships in Real-World Applications

One key idea in OOP is the concept of state. The state of an object refers to its data at a particular moment in time. You should use OOP when your system has entities with states that change and interact. For example, in a video game, characters and items have changing health points and positions; in a banking system, accounts have changing balances and transaction histories; and in a robotics system, sensors and motors have changing readings and positions. At any given moment, you can take a snapshot of the system, showing the current state of all its components. Let's now take a closer look at how OOP is used in these systems.

#### Video game

In video games, objects are used to represent various entities, each with their own properties and behaviors. Making video games is a common use of OOP because it helps manage the complexity of game development. For instance:

- `Player` object: Might have attributes like health, score, and inventory, and methods for moving, attacking, and interacting with the game world.
- `Enemy` objects: Have similar attributes and methods, tailored to their specific behaviors and interactions with the player.
- `Item` objects: Include attributes for type and value, and methods for being picked up or used by the player.

![Game characters](./figures/game.jpg)
*A player and goblins in a game, each with different health levels.*

This object-oriented approach allows game developers to create complex, interactive environments where different entities interact in predictable and manageable ways.

#### Banking system

A banking system is another example where objects are used to represent various entities and their interactions. In this system, customers, accounts, and transactions are modeled as objects:

- `Customer` objects: Have attributes such as name, address, and customer ID, and methods for opening accounts and making transactions.
- `Account` objects: Have attributes like balance, account number, and transaction history, and methods for depositing and withdrawing money.
- `Transaction` objects: Represent each transaction with attributes like transaction ID, amount, date, and type (deposit, withdrawal, transfer), and methods for processing the transaction.

This approach allows the banking system to manage customer interactions, account operations, and transactions in an organized and efficient manner.

#### Robotics system

In a robotic system, objects can be used to manage different components, such as sensors, motors, and controllers. For example, consider a Robot object that interacts with various other objects:

- `Robot` object: Represents the overall robot, containing attributes and methods that define its general properties and behaviors.
- `Sensor` objects: Represent specific types of sensors, like temperature sensors or distance sensors, with attributes that describe their characteristics, such as current readings and status.
- `Motor` objects: Represent the robot's actuators, which control movement and actions.
- `Controller` object: Acts as the brain of the robot, processing input from sensors and sending commands to the motors to perform actions. It makes decisions based on sensor data.

The `Controller` coordinates the interactions between sensors and motors to ensure the robot performs its tasks correctly. This structured relationship simplifies the management and coordination of the robot's various components.

## A Glimpse into OOP Code

We have gone over the basic theory of classes, objects, attributes, and methods. Now it's time to look at some code. Let's look at a video game example. We'll start by creating a simple `Monster` class, which you could also call `Enemy`. This class will have attributes to store the monster's data and a constructor to initialize these attributes. Later, we will add methods for the monster to perform actions like moving and attacking.

### Defining a Class and Creating Objects

In OOP, as we've seen multiple times, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. Let's start by defining the `Monster` class:

```python
class Monster:
  // Add blueprint here
END class
```

We use the keyword `class` followed by the class name. It's a convention to capitalize class names in `CamelCase` and use `snake_case` for variables.

Now we can add `name`, `health`, and `energy` as attributes of this class:

```python
class Monster:
  // Attributes
  name = "Goblin"
  health = 90
  energy = 40
END class
```

We can create Monster objects by calling the `Monster` class like a function and storing the objects in variables, such as `monster1` and `monster2`:

```python
class Monster:
  // Attributes
  name = "Goblin"
  health = 90
  energy = 40
END class

monster1 = Monster()
monster2 = Monster()
```

These `monster1` and `monster2` objects are different and stored in different memory locations on your computer. This means that each object has its own set of attributes and can be modified independently of the other. Even though they are both created from the same Monster class, they exist separately in memory.

But right now, all calls to `Monster()` will create a monster with `name = "Goblin"`, `health = 90`, and `energy = 40`. The whole point of classes is for them to be a blueprint, not to specify the exact details themselves. What if we want a monster with `100` health and `10` energy, named "Shark"? To achieve this flexibility, we need a way to initialize each monster with different values when we create them. This is where constructors come in.

### Constructor

## The Four Pillars of OOP: A PIE

### Abstraction

#### Example: Simplifying complex robot systems

### Polymorphism

![Animals speaking](./figures/polymorphism-speak.jpg)
*Different animals (dog, cat, cow) inherit from `Animal` class and each implement their own `speak()` method.*

#### Example: Interchanging Robot Components

### Inheritance

Classes can inherent behaviors from eachother, forming hierarchies.

![Family inheritance](./figures/family-inheritance.jpg)
*Family with children inheriting features from their parents: The son has his dad's curly hair and his mom's eye color and hair color, while the daughter has her dad's eye color and her mom's straight hair and hair color.*

#### Example: Specialized Robot Types

### Encapsulation
